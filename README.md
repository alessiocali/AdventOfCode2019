# Advent Of Code 2019

 This repository will hold my implementation for the solutions (in C++17) of the Advent Of Code challenge. If you don't know what it is, check it out, it's pretty cool: https://adventofcode.com/2019/

# Disclaimer

None of this is supposed to be a good example in programming, nor to be optimized in any way possible. In fact, if you ask me, some implementations are pretty crappy. I'm writing these "just to make it work" so don't expect too much from it :)
